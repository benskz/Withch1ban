## Setup
Very complicated.
```
npm install
```
### build
Unfortunately also very complicated.
```
npm run build
```

### Development
Even more complicated.
```
npm run client
```
and go to ```http://localhost:8080/```. Run tests with ```npm run test```, will look for files ending in ```.test.js```.
